.MD3 support for Blender
========================

Up-to-date addon (Blender 2.6.9 supported!) for working with Quake 3 model format, written from scratch.

Can deal with animation (via the Shape Keys), textures and md3 tags (added as Empty objects).

I've used [this](http://www.icculus.org/homepages/phaethon/q3a/formats/md3format.html) format reference.
